# Node.js-Series
This repository is a collection of practical projects and implementations that I built while following the Node.js series by Piyush Garg. The series provided a deep dive into various core concepts of Node.js, and to solidify my understanding, I completed multiple mini-projects covering a wide range of backend development topics.
